                    My organization works with Save Our Street Ministries after school care. We serve as leaders teaching small lessons and helping with basic math and other forms of homework.
                    For younger groups, we will lead in a game and just keep children entertained until their parents return from Bible study or other event.

                     We actively participate in Build, where Central church provides the tools and we all divide into groups to serve the community.
                    This year, we went and spread around fifty pounds of mulch and re-did every flower bed. I really enjoy build as it allows you to meet a new very friendly family and get closer to the guys we work with.
